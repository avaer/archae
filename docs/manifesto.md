# Manifesto

What follows is the "what" and "why" of Archae -- the problem it solves and how it solves it.

## What is Archae?

Archae is a _specification for `npm` modules_ that allows a _loader engine_ to dynamically load and unload application functionality across a multi-factor (client/server/worker) application stack.

The specification includes a definition of how modules ("mods") should be loaded and unloaded, an isomorphic API for requesting these things to happen, and a uniform way for mods to declare their own APIs which they can use to communicate.

Archae is kind of like your very own lightweight, modular, distributed Javascript operating system. And it's simpler than it sounds.

## Why do we need Archae?

## How does it work?
